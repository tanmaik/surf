# surf

for so long, the browser has been a very single-player application, while every other app have dozens of social features baked into them. surf aims to bring your friends & teammates to the browsing experience, by allowing you to seamlessly share browser workspaces. 

while this is a chromium-based extension prototype, this concept could be taken to build a whole new browser that is social-first.
